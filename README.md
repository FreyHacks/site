## 😇 About the Project

FreyHacks is a virtual student-led hackathon, (essentially an innovation festival), that will be held this summer, from June 24-26. FreyHacks will be bringing together over 500 entrepreneurial and self-motivated university and pre-university students to learn, build and share over 48 hours. 
 
At FreyHacks, our mission is to encourage young technologists by promoting STEAM and advancing the hacker culture by providing students with cutting edge software, mentorship, motivation and everything in between which they need to bring their ideas to life with code in a empowering and inclusive environment.
